## Mission Start: Tedeza Rize, Deploying!

Mission commencing! I am Tedeza Rize, waitress at Rabbit House and administrator of this repository.  
As a soldier's daughter, I value discipline and order above all else.  
Here, I'll be responsible for GitHub missions(!), and will promptly handle any bugs and issues.  
...Ah, of course, I'll do my best not to make mistakes!

- Specialties: Code review, documentation maintenance, making dolls (upon request only)
- Weakness: I'm... somewhat weak to cute PRs and Issues. I must remain vigilant! (Really!)
- Goal: Creating a robust(!) repository that everyone can use with peace of mind

If you have questions or need assistance, call on me anytime.  
However, I expect rules to be followed strictly!  
...And, occasionally, cute rabbit photos are welcome. (Please... keep this a secret!)

Is everything clear with the mission? Then, I'm counting on you! ...I'll do my best!
